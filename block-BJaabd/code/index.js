// Write your code below each problems:

/*
Write a program that asks the user his/her age and check for the following conditions :

- `if` the age is between 12-55 then print the message "You can participate in the marathon".
- `if` the age is between 4-11 then print the message " You are too young to participate in the marathon".

// Loops
/*
Given a positive integer `n`. Print the word (hello) in format of heeeello (letter 'e' must be repeated `n` times). Take input from prompt and print the result in alert.

Example:
n = 1 => output: hello
n = 7 => output: heeeeeeello

/* Switch Statement

 🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take a number value from user and alert the message if it matches the conditions.
* [ ] ONE, if `number` is equal to 1.
* [ ] TWO, if `number` is equal to 2.
* [ ] THREE, if `number` is equal to 3.
* [ ] FOUR, if `number` is equal to 4.
* [ ] FIVE, if `number` is equal to 5.
* [ ] SIX, if `number` is equal to 6.
* [ ] SEVEN, if `number` is equal to 7.
* [ ] EIGHT, if `number` is equal to 8.
* [ ] NINE, if `number` is equal to 9.
* [ ] PLEASE TRY AGAIN, if  is none of the above.

/*
🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take the value of `marks` (0-100) from user using `prompt` and `alert` the message (Your Grade is AA) as giver below.
* [ ] `AA` if `marks` is greater than 90.
* [ ] `AB` if `marks` is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90
* [ ] `BB` if `marks` is greater than 70 and less than or equal to 80
* [ ] `BC` if `marks` is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70

/* Calculator
 🎖Make a simple calculator with these functions. Using prompt, type conversion, if else statement. Use prompt to take the input from user i.e two numbers and an operation (Add, Sub, Mul, Div).

  ⛑ Rule
    * [ ] While substracting and dividing keep in mind the number one should be greater then number two. If not show alert saying `Number Two is larger then Number one`.
  ⚡️ Operations
    * [ ] Add
    * [ ] Sub
    * [ ] Mul
    * [ ] Div
